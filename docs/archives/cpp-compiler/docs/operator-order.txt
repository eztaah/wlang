1. Parenthesis Operations `()` have the highest priority and can be used to change the default order of evaluation
.
2. Unary Operations such as binary NOT `~`, sign change `-`, and other unary operators.

3. Multiplication/Division Operations: Multiplication `*`, division `/`, and modulo `%`.

4. Addition and Subtraction Operations: Addition `+` and subtraction `-`.

5. Shift Operations: Left shift `<<` and right shift `>>`.

6. Binary AND Operation `&` comes after shift operations.

7. Binary XOR Operation `^` comes after binary AND.

8. Binary OR Operation `|` comes after binary XOR, giving it a lower priority than binary AND and XOR.
