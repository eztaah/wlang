Creating a video that involves a mix of screen recordings, stock footage, and other visuals like whiteboard drawings, while using text-to-speech (TTS) for narration, requires a systematic approach. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the process, focusing on scripting and recording:

### 1. **Scriptwriting**
   - **Draft the Full Script:** Start by writing the entire script of your video. This script should include everything you want to convey in the video, including technical explanations, transitions, and any other commentary.
     - **Include Visual Cues:** As you write the script, annotate it with visual cues. For example, indicate when a screen recording should be shown, when stock footage should appear, or when you’ll be drawing on a whiteboard. This will help you visualize the entire video and plan your shots.
     - **Plan for TTS:** Write the script in a conversational tone to make the TTS audio sound as natural as possible. Include appropriate pauses and emphasis points, as some TTS software allows you to control pacing and intonation.

### 2. **Storyboarding and Visual Planning**
   - **Create a Storyboard:** Sketch out or use software to create a storyboard that visually represents each scene of your video. This doesn’t need to be highly detailed but should include the following:
     - **Key Frames:** Visualize the key moments in the video, such as when a graph appears, when you switch to a screen recording, or when a whiteboard explanation starts.
     - **Transitions:** Plan how you’ll transition between different types of content (e.g., from a screen recording to stock footage).
   - **List Visual Assets:** Identify all the visual elements you’ll need:
     - **Screen Recordings:** List the code examples, IDE views, or terminal outputs you’ll need to capture.
     - **Stock Footage:** Decide on any stock footage or B-roll that will enhance your explanations (e.g., a clip showing someone coding, abstract animations for concepts).
     - **Whiteboard/Graphics:** Plan any diagrams or whiteboard drawings. You can either record yourself drawing them live or create them digitally.

### 3. **Generate Audio with TTS**
   - **Choose a TTS Tool:** Use a high-quality TTS tool that offers natural-sounding voices and the ability to control the tone, speed, and emphasis. Options like Amazon Polly, Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, or commercial tools like Descript can work well.
   - **Generate Audio Files:** Break down your script into manageable sections or scenes, then generate the TTS audio for each section. Ensure that the generated audio matches the pacing and tone you want for your video.
   - **Organize Audio Files:** Save each segment of the audio with clear filenames corresponding to the sections of your script. This organization will make it easier to match audio with visuals later on.

### 4. **Recording and Gathering Visuals**
   - **Screen Recording:**
     - **Prepare Your Environment:** Set up your IDE or terminal to show the code examples you’ll be demonstrating. Ensure that your screen is uncluttered and that the code is clearly visible.
     - **Record in Segments:** Follow your storyboard and script to record each screen segment. Use OBS Studio or similar software to capture the recordings. Match your screen actions to the TTS script as closely as possible.
     - **Retakes:** Don’t hesitate to re-record segments if they don’t match the script or if there are mistakes.
   - **Stock Footage and B-roll:**
     - **Search for Footage:** Find appropriate stock footage that matches the visual cues in your script. Websites like Pexels, Unsplash, or paid services like Shutterstock can be used.
     - **Organize Footage:** Download and label the footage according to the scene or script section it corresponds to.
   - **Whiteboard/Graph Recording:**
     - **Live Recording:** If you’re recording a physical whiteboard, set up your camera to capture clear and steady footage. Use good lighting and consider recording multiple takes.
     - **Digital Graphics:** If you’re creating digital graphics, tools like Adobe Illustrator, Canva, or even simple drawing tools like MS Paint can be used to create diagrams. Record your screen as you draw them if you want to show the process.

### 5. **Editing**
   - **Import and Sync Audio:** Import all your TTS audio files into your video editing software. Place them on the timeline in the order of your script.
   - **Add Visuals to Match Audio:**
     - **Screen Recordings:** Drag and drop your screen recordings onto the timeline, aligning them with the corresponding audio segments.
     - **Stock Footage:** Insert stock footage where your script indicates, ensuring it visually matches the narration.
     - **Whiteboard/Graphics:** Add your whiteboard recordings or digital diagrams at the appropriate points in the video. Sync them with the relevant sections of the TTS audio.
   - **Fine-Tune the Edit:**
     - **Adjust Timing:** Ensure that the visuals and audio are perfectly synchronized. Make small adjustments to the duration of each clip if necessary.
     - **Transitions and Effects:** Add transitions between different types of footage to keep the video flowing smoothly. Consider adding simple effects like zooming in on code or highlighting parts of the screen.
     - **Subtitles and Annotations:** If desired, add subtitles or on-screen text to emphasize important points. This can also help clarify complex parts of the video.

### 6. **Final Review and Export**
   - **Review the Full Video:** Watch the entire video from start to finish to ensure that everything flows correctly, that there are no technical glitches, and that the pacing feels right.
   - **Get Feedback:** If possible, have someone else review the video. Fresh eyes might catch things you missed.
   - **Export Settings:** Choose high-quality export settings (1080p resolution, high bitrate) to ensure your video looks professional on YouTube.

### 7. **Post-Production**
   - **Create a Thumbnail:** Design a thumbnail that clearly conveys the content of your video. Tools like Canva or Photoshop can help you create eye-catching designs.
   - **Upload and Optimize on YouTube:** Upload your video, then optimize the title, description, tags, and end screens to maximize reach.
   - **Promote:** Share the video on relevant forums, social media, and programming communities to attract your target audience.

By following this order, you’ll systematically build your video, ensuring that your TTS narration is seamlessly integrated with your visuals. This method allows you to maintain control over every aspect of the video, from scripting to final editing, resulting in a polished and professional end product.
